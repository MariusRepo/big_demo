The app will have one common business flow which will be called from multiple sources
that we will showcase

Remote Queues
	Local queue

MQInputs -> some MQOut
	Remote
	Local

Mapping nodes 
	(maybe + 1 ESQL node with data mapping)
Transformation nodes from 1 format to another
DFDL on nodes to ensure the data structure is valid

1 file node as input 
Maybe file output node to write some file to the disk (logs/erros/exceptions)

1 database node that connects to DB and does some query

accepting REST calls -> triggering flows
add routing labels

add exception handling TRY/CATCH/THROW

have a trigger mechanism with a timer node
